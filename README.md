# Handwritten_digit_recognition
This project focuses on implementing a neural network for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of digits ranging from 0 to 9, making it a standard benchmark for image classification tasks. The neural network processes these images through an input layer, hidden layers with activation functions like ReLU, and a final output layer with softmax activation to classify the digits. The model is trained using backpropagation and optimization algorithms such as Adam or SGD, achieving high accuracy on the test set. This project highlights the effectiveness of neural networks in solving real-world classification problems, providing a foundation for exploring advanced machine learning applications.
