Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Neural Networks
This project implements a neural network to recognize handwritten digits. The neural network is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0â€“9). The model uses supervised learning to classify these digits based on their pixel values.

Features
Dataset: MNIST, a standard dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
Model Architecture:
Input Layer: Processes 28x28 pixel images flattened into a 784-dimensional vector.
Hidden Layers: One or more dense layers with activation functions like ReLU.
Output Layer: A dense layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) using softmax activation for classification.
Training: The model is trained using backpropagation and an optimization algorithm like Adam or SGD.
Evaluation: Accuracy and loss metrics are used to evaluate performance on test data.
Dependencies
Python
TensorFlow/Keras
Numpy
Matplotlib (for visualizing results)
Usage
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the notebook/script to train the model.
Test the model with new handwritten digits or the MNIST test set.
